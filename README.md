# Stock Price Prediction: Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

## Overview

This project compares two time series forecasting methods using TSX Composite Index data:

- Random Forest (Machine Learning)  
- LSTM Neural Network with PyTorch (Deep Learning)

## Purpose

Apply ML and DL techniques to predict stock prices by:

- Training a Random Forest on lagged features  
- Building an LSTM network
- Evaluating models with metrics and visualizations  

## Project Components

- Data preprocessing: normalization, windowing, train/test split  
- Random Forest Regressor on tabular lagged data  
- Multi-layer LSTM neural network  
- Evaluation both visual and statistical

## Disclaimer

This project was educational and does not include financial analysis or trading strategies. I just wanted to explore some models with familiar data.
